# Lemac

This is a C++ implementation of the [lemac cryptographic hash](https://doi.org/10.46586/tosc.v2024.i2.35-67) by Augustin Bariant.

Lemac is very interesting because it utilizes AES hardware acceleration which is very common.

It is based on the public domain code in [https://github.com/AugustinBariant/Implementations_LeMac_PetitMac/](https://github.com/AugustinBariant/Implementations_LeMac_PetitMac/) but has been heavily modified to use C++ and run clean with sanitizers.


# Performance

On an AMD zen4 system, the hashing speed is about 68 GB/s for larger (>100 kB) inputs. This can be compared to the non-cryptographic [xxh3/xxh128 hashes](https://xxhash.com/) which reach about 87 GB/s on the same hardware (measured with `xxhsum -b`). For bulk processing, it is slightly faster than the non-cryptographic [clhash](https://github.com/simdhash/clhash) which reaches 0.1 cycles per byte (measured on the same system, with it's provided benchmark).

The time per hash on the system above (using gcc 14) is approximately

 1. Initialization: 74 ns (paid only once, if you can `.reset()` the hasher and reuse it for the next input, like the benchmark does.)
 2. Hashing: around 68 GB/s (0.08 cycles per byte)
 3. Finalization: around 30 ns

For tiny inputs, the hashing is dominated by the initialization and finalization. The cost of initialization corresponds to hashing about 5 kB of extra data. The cost of finalization about 2 kB of extra data.

If all data to be hashed is known up front, the `oneshot()` function is more efficient to use than `update()` followed by `finalize()`.

To build and run the benchmark:

    cmake -B build-release -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build-release
    build-release/benchmark/benchmark

# Support

This code runs with clang(>=16) and gcc (>=12) on amd64 linux. It requires C++20. It may work with earlier compiler versions, but those are not tested in CI.

It should run on any amd64 cpu with aes support, which is most current desktop cpus.

Support for arm64 is planned.

# Usage

## Command line tool lemacsum

After compilation, there is a binary **lemacsum** which works in similar spirit to sha256sum, xxhsum,  b3sum etc.

## As a library

Although yet untested, it should be possible to consume this as a cmake subproject.

# License

Boost 1.0 license, which allows commercial use and modification.

# Quality

The goals are (in order)

 1. correctness
 2. run clean with both undefined and address sanitizers
 3. performance
 4. readability and maintainability
 5. portability
